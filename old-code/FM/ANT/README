A. The files in our package
    1. fm_train: the implementation of our training algorithm
    2. fm_predict: the script to do prediction given a model
    3. libsvmread.c: the source of a MEX function to read data set in LIBSVM format
    4. make.m: the script to compile libsvmread.c
    5. fourclass_scale.tr: an example training set 
    6. fourclass_scale.te: an example test set

B. Usage
    See fm_train.m and fm_predict.m for the training and prediction modules, respectively.

C. Steps to run the code
    1. Switch to the ``code'' directory
        > cd code
    1. Lunch MATLAB or OCTAVE command line
        > matlab
        or
        > octave
    2. Execute the demo case.
        >> example

D. Trouble shooting for executing make.m
    If make.m does not work on MATLAB (especially for Windows), try 'mex
    -setup' to choose a suitable compiler for mex. Make sure your compiler
    is accessible and workable. Then type 'make' to start the
    installation.

    Example:

            matlab>> mex -setup
            (ps: MATLAB will show the following messages to setup default compiler.)
            Please choose your compiler for building external interface (MEX) files:
            Would you like mex to locate installed compilers [y]/n? y
            Select a compiler:
            [1] Microsoft Visual C/C++ version 7.1 in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio
            [0] None
            Compiler: 1
            Please verify your choices:
            Compiler: Microsoft Visual C/C++ 7.1
            Location: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio
            Are these correct?([y]/n): y

            matlab>> make

    On Unix systems, if neither make.m nor 'mex -setup' works, please use
    Makefile and type 'make' in a command window. Note that we assume
    your MATLAB is installed in '/usr/local/matlab'. If not, please change
    MATLABDIR in Makefile.

    Example:
            linux> make
